# skeletonUI

A skeleton screen is an animated placeholder that simulates the layout of a website while data is being loaded.

They let the user know that some content is loading and, more importantly, provide an indication of what is loading, whether it's an image, text, card, and so on.

This gives the user the impression that the website is faster because they already know what type of content is loading before it appears. This is referred to as perceived performance.

# how to?

It is important to note that skeleton UI only loads if the network speed is slow or in a real world scenario the incoming data is way to much and needs time.

In this example for simplicity sake I've added a timeout which simulates a real world scenario, and gives a feeling that the data is loading.
